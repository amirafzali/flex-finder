add custom date for timeslots available
make everything lowercase
add removal logic for accept logic for user to terminate active appointment

Needs to add functionality to update timeslots available, workout types, etc for profile


FIRESTORE:
----------------

Create collection for Profile, Search, Scheduler
Profile will also have scheduler stuff but we will want to have a seperate collection also so that it is easier to search for things
via firestore query opeartors on the documents(userid: scheduler stuff) of the given scheduler collection.

Otherwise, the format will remain the same!
May try experimenting with regex for search!
Need to port existing app to firestore potentially! Easier to then move to javascript!
Use login ID or username from login step as the username stuff for firestore.

Add search functionality such that it prompts user to enter school, gym(auto populates after school), exercise time, username, time interval.
	-> This way, atleast one of the options has to be filled to be searched.
	-> THe search will be made easy now since we can simplfy run a query over the schedulability collection which will essentially
		go through each username and the corresponding fields searched with others remain unused, thus easier search.


MUST TEST ALL THIS IN PYTHON for firestore and searchability before moving to react, saves hassle!

            
            .update(
            {f'timeslots_available.{appointment_id}': firestore.DELETE_FIELD})



NEED TO TEST IF SCHEDULER WORKS CORRECTLY!
add functionality to update profile appointments etc, have one of the other guys do that.
